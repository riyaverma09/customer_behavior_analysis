# customer_behavior_analysis
data analytic project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python ,Sql and Power BI.

# 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

# 🔍 Project Workflow / Steps

#### 1.Data Loading

-> Loaded the dataset using Python (Pandas).

-> Checked data structure, columns, and data types.

#### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-> Analyzed distributions, trends, and patterns.

-> Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

-> Visualized key insights using charts and graphs.

#### 3.Data Cleaning

-> Handled missing and duplicate values.

-> Corrected data types.

-> Prepared clean data for SQL and visualization.

#### 4.SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

-> Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

-> Wrote SQL queries for:

a. Aggregations

b. Filtering

c. Joins

d. Business-specific insights

 #### 5.Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
